# docker-compose-challenge

## Create a simple, mock API with Docker Compose

Go to https://docs.docker.com/compose/ for more info on Docker Compose.

1. Use the stubbed out `docker-compose.yaml` in this repo for this challenge.
2. Setup an haproxy container as the API "front door". Configure haproxy to start on port 8100. Expose port 8100 to the host.
3. Setup a mock API cluster using the `nginxdemos/hello` Docker image. Make sure there are 3 instances of `nginxdemos/hello` running.
4. Modify the haproxy config to route the `/api` URL context to the API cluster and have it load balance across the 3 nginx instances.
5. Zip up the final project and return to us.

## Outcome

- Start everything by running `docker-compose up` in the directory of the `docker-compose.yaml` file
- In the browser, go to http://localhost:8100/api
- As you click the browser refresh, observe the "Server name" cycling through the 3 backend instance id's.
